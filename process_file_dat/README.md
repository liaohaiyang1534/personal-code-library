# Process File DAT: Convert DAT to SAC and SEGY Formats

This repository contains scripts to process `.dat` files, converting them into `SAC` and `SEGY` formats for seismic data analysis. These tools are specifically designed to handle large datasets efficiently through multi-threaded or concurrent processing.

Note that the scripts are designed to work with the DAS machine and its specific output data file type, making them primarily used within our research group. However, both SAC and SEGY file formats are widely recognized and commonly used in seismic data analysis and processing.
