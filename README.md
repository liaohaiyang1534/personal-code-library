# personal-code-library

this is my personal code that i use them to solve my paractical application which is Rayleigh wave dispersion calculation and inversion using Distributed Acoustic Sensing.

So several modules are concluded.

Stepping into each Folders and look up the README.md, you can know the meaning of them and ways to use them.

Thanks coming here and Good Luck!
